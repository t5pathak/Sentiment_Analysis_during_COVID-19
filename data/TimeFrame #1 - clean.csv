Covering your face while sneezing or coughing with your inner arm or in a Kleenex or towel is something you should have been doing all along not just now. People wake up this is just a control tactic to get people divided about mask. Mask are a crock
Surely this picture should show the characters wearing masks as they are mandatory !
they also need to wear a mask so they can protect others from the sleeve full of germs he will pass around to others on the bus.
Why is the WHO not encouraging mask wearing... we had this message before and the virus is still spreading
And who will believe an Organization that has permitted to chair a person from the Country where Covid started? Where are the case studies that mask works?  Why wait 8 months after temps have reached into the mid 90's and higher to FORCE us to wear masks? Your breathing in more Carbon Dioxide than Oxygen along with your sweat and bacteria that is trapped in your mask.
Wear a mask and you are protecting yourself and others. Simple.
"Once upon a time it was called, Having Manners and you were taught at a early age to Cover Coughs and Sneezes."
Why aren't any of those passengers wearing a mask
This won’t be a problem if you wear a mask in public!
Haha where are the mask  in the picture they all sitting in the bus or was that not a recommendation from the WHO you are a joke hopefully all country will stop funding you and the rest who belongs to u organisation
Masks should be mandatory. Proper use of masks is also necessary. Keeping it over your chin or lips only wont cover anyone.
"Why isn’t anyone on this bus wearing a mask? That helps too, you know."
Usually just scroll past WHO stuff but this did make me laugh out loud.
And then you touch someone else with that same elbow????
Facemasks should be required on public transportation.
Where are their masks?
Wear your freaking mask
Cough or sneeze anywhere in public and you automatically have COVID ! some people need to relax just a little...there is allergy coughs and sneezes..there is normal illness that sometime cause this...no need to get bent out of shape every time someone does this naturally.
Should be wearing a good mask when in the public!
"Don’t be ashamed to wear a mask either way it is safe x even with a common flu . Face up . Wear a mask . Bandana is fun for kids .  I’m going to start sewing  masks , silk wool poly fibre silk wool five  layers . This is our future to keep safe and rid of germs . In any case .   Gotta be done!"
"Everybody should ware a mask, every where"
Show consideration and wear a mask!
People do these things without thinking...but refuse to wear a mask??????
"Who is one of the biggest frauds and failures we ever managed on planet earth   Do the opposite of what who says, start thinking and you will be healthy."
Some people don't care. In the super market where I live I was the only one wearing a mask. Crazy
And passengers also don't hate those sneeze( with precautions) it's a natural process....
I thought all of these people were supposed to be wearing a mask?  What happened to that?  Or was that just last week?
"WEAR A MASK! SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IF EVERYONE WEARS A MASK, WE COULD NEARLY ELIMINATE THE VIRUS!"
This is NOT a new concept! The WHO seems to be trying to be relevant.
WEAR A MASK unless you want society sheltering in place for all eternity!!!
I can’t understand why people should sneeze into their elbow rather than a disposable tissue. When I see people doing the elbow nudge I do think to myself  - germs - passing from person to person!
just like we do in Holland.
WEAR A MASK on public transit!
"If possible,  we should all avoid breathing altogether,  it seems to be the cause of all our problems!!!"
"Hannah Sellers   they eased off on their mask chat then?  funny thing is I read someone comment about wearing a mask to sneeze into! It’s your body clearing it’s self out and she’s suggesting we all suck that back in. Common sense tells us to cover a sneeze this way anyway, or with a tissue, handkerchief if you have one to hand."
Luv reading the neurotic commentary below.  Telling folks how to sneeze and how to live their life. Interesting
Wear a mask ! So many people are not doing this !
.  this is what they were for and no excuse for coughing or sneezing without one.
"And yes, do this even when you’re wearing a mask"
"This should be common etiquette at any time, not just during a pandemic!"
What a laugh they're not even wearing masks in this advert after we've all been told wee have to. If anyones got a cough or cold they should not be out at all let alone on London transport..
Every one should wear mask also for effective  protection.
"It's too bad hospital beds go to these people when they get sick. Mask wearers first, non-mask wearers last. Just saying."
"Take a tablet of hydroxy chloroquine every morning, it is a prophylactic medication that prevents covid."
It means without masks we can survive
You should always cover when coughing or sneezing. Not just now. No one ever wanted to have any one else’s germs on them. Duh!
"Pretty sad people still need to be told how to cough and sneeze! Sorry but I don’t need the CDC, WHO or the government to tell me how to practice good hygiene and to be considerate of others."
What about coughing into your mask and then breathing in your own germs...asking for a friend...
"There are still people that think masks make them choke in their own carbon dioxide even though this is not true, they still think they shouldn’t have to wear them if they aren’t sick because they don’t understand that Covid can be asymptomatic.. WHO and CDC need to start a campaign and blast social media debunking this."
Why the hell don’t these people have masks on!
"coughing etc, but no mention of masks."
Better still  WEAR A MASK
Let's show some consideration to the Ethiopians that the director of the WHO personally tortured to death while working with the Communist party there.
"why did you do an ad with the characters not wearing a mask  - and yes besides wearing a mask in public transport you can still also make sure you cough or sneeze into your elbow, heck anything extra helps - helps you helps others"
We have learned a lot more due to COVID19  COVID19 is real and dangerous  How many people get flu every year..... because we never cover coughs and wear masks So wear your mask and cover your cough. Stay 2m apart from other people Do you hear people die?
"Good advice! And wear a mask, better advice! I encourage positivity here, to all folks of the world! Not wearing a mask could mean you and others get sick. Your child, or your parents; people more vulnerable. It can't hurt you to wear a mask. Proud Canadian mask wearer and social distancer!"
"I know this will get lost in the comments but sometimes I like to go into the backyard, lay in the garden, then cover myself with dirt & pretend I'm a carrot."
Everyone always say where a mask. But now they say you don't have to when you vote. HELLO..... This is all about politics. Swim in water parks and pools but can't get a book from the library and no gym and no movie and eat in a restaurant but not fast food restaurant. Some churches have only outside service. Just government telling us how to live.
Perhaps if common sense was taught in school instead of common core we would not have half of the problems society is experiencing...
Keep spray hand sanitizer if you need to cough or sneeze cover your mouth with your inner elbow. Spray hand sanitizer on inner elbow after sneezing or coughing.
I hope you weren't successful and passed it on to someone at risk...
"You know what occured to me the other day? If you cough into your elbow - then do elbow bumps with someone (or more) at a meeting...then they cough into their elbow,                their mouth is very near to the germs that were on your elbow and touched his   jacket!!"
"Even if the art is older than the recent change of advice about masks, masks can be easily added with photoshop.  It is misleading to show the interior of a bus where passengers are not wearing masks!   Please, please, please change the art. This is serious."
Oh my...It's a cartoon people. Everyone should know by now that in confined spaces and transit masks are good practice.  Although A+ for identifying it.
Everybody I see coughing or sneezing does it into their hands. Nobody has common sense these days
This command of wearing mask should be changed to cover your noes and mouth. Some are fulfilling righteousness of wearing mask. They cover their chin. Some take it up to the forehead
WHO showing people without masks in a public transport? Outrageous!
I worked n a hospital we just pulled our uniform neck open and coughed into the inside.  Because your arms are bare it worked better for us.
This used to be common courtesy taught to all children 2 years old and older. Manners need to be taught at home and not left to WHO to teach adults with posters!
Where are their masks?  I thought it is now mandatory on public transport in most countries.  (And of course always cover your mouth coughing or sneezing whatever the reason.)
"You should give this advice: « hey man, just make sure to say: « sorry guys! » » It would be the same..."
Why are your advertisement characters without mouth cover .
Laughing stock. The WHO are idiots. Would be better to tell people to use tissues NOT their sleeves
"Mask requirements are not working and people are not wearing them. No matter what article I read, no one is discussing the REAL reason for mask which is to SLOW the spread so that hospitals have the room and supplies to treat everyone.  It's like no one get it at all  even tho it's been explained over and over and over."
"If you need to tell grow adults to do that, I think we have an issue."
Yes so definitely true obey the rules that the government's set out for all of us to stay safe. And to stop the spread so to each and everyone else ppl's obey and stick with these rules
We have received several ICU patients. Who decided to hang around covid positive people to get “ herd immunity “. Hey guys keep it up. I need the job security.  The morgue guy is also getting a lot more work.  Thank you to all the people not wearing masks. We are getting a lot of mandatory overtime. I am getting a lot of muscles proning and rolling patient s to keep them alive. Keep it up and there will be no one left to vote for your supreme leader
Why has it taken a pandemic for people to realize they should not be sneezing into open air
"That's just common courtesy, it should always have been that way. It's called manners."
"Or...you can carry Kleenex with you at all times. I do. If I have enough warning that a cough or sneeze is coming on, I pull out a Kleenex and use it. This saves me from spewing my germs onto my clothes.  Good idea to carry with you a little bottle of hand sanitizer, too. We should clean our hands after using a Kleenex. Hand sanitizer is good when you can’t wash your hands."
No problem if you already have a mask on. As you should travelling on public transport
The rule everywhere should be to wear a mask on public transportation!
Why you shouldn’t touch elbows instead of handshakes.
"All you should  know people is that we've  to follow the five preventive  measures  wash hand regularly, physical distancing, sneeze en cough in th folded elbow,  use hand sanitizer  and no hand shakes. Mask up in th crowded  places now every one  is aware of these the WHO was trying to show us on how sit in public and also how to cough and sneeze"
Unfortunately personal hygiene has gone out the window. The amount of people I’ve seen walk straight out of toilets and not wash their hands is horrendous. So basically they have to be reminded to wash their hands.
", only sick people should wear a mask. But if it makes you feel better, ok. Don’t hassle people who aren’t sick and choose freedom over a muzzle."
"it would be much more accurate to use tissue paper, if not, how naturally it sneezes should be (head down by tilting between two knees). If you sneezed into your elbow, where did the droplets from your body remain? On your dress. Then you tied your arms and your hand touched the area you sneezed. Then you got stuck somewhere. Then someone else grabbed the same place. Let's say you are wearing a short sleeve dress, how will you sneeze into your elbow? It has to be smart and logical. When people sneeze, their heads and necks are leaning towards the ground and sneezing with a high pressure, and the droplets from sneezing do not fly into the air. People are created like this."
What is a big joke is a face shield. Virus can easily get in and out. People wear them only so they don't get in trouble for not having a face covering. WHO does say only people that should be wearing a mask are working in the medical field and caring for the sick and people that have bad health issues and low immune system. I had a customer pass out in front of her 10 year old son and her son took off his mask and threw it on the ground. How do you think he will act at school when he sees his mom passed out in front of him. Two days later they came back and the son was clinging to his mom. A guy passed out wearing one while driving and crashed into a pole. Not everyone can tolerate wearing one especially if never wore one ever in their lives.
"So sad that grown adults are just now learning basic, proper hygiene.  Glad I’m a responsible parent that actually teaches my children manners...my four year old always sneezes into his elbow, but other grown family members were apparently never taught this"
"Sad that the CDC is actually having to put put reminders for something that should be basic manners.. I was doing this stuff since 5 years old. ""Cover your mouth!"" If I didnt I got in trouble. Like is basic manners and hygiene not a thing anymore? Must not be."
"has nothing to do with compliance, it is about caring enough about your grandmother and grangfather and parents to keep them safe. hope your family thinks you are special in light of you not thinking they are special"
elbow not safe.
I thought you require all to wear a Mask. It’s much safer to sneeze or cough with your mask on than sneeze with your elbow with no mask. In the picture all are not wearing mask. Very dangerous if the virus linger in the air for 3 hours.
"Um....why would they need to do that when they have a mask on to stop all that spray?? Tired of the changing narratives. So, no masks needed on public transportation so long as you use your manners and cover your sneeze appropriately?"
"To most of the brainwashed people on here thinking that wearing those cheap mask helps protect you from viruses newsflash they don't. My son's friends mum is a nurse, and they wear a special type of fitted mask.  These mask which surgeons and nurses wear are completely different to the ones you see people outside wearing."
"Also, don't bully someone if they cough or sneeze. Some of us have allergies and other reasons why we cough and sneeze, not COVID-19 related. Yes, I wear a mask, and yes I cough and sneeze into my elbow. I've also been stared at and approached rudely because I've sneezed and coughed due to allergies. I had my mask on when this happened. Please don't jump to conclusions, and don't bully each other."
Tissue paper and handkerchiefs do not exist in the world of WHO? And where are the face masks?? And then you go to the office with your arms full of ...erh...
"Cough into your mask and do NOT pull it down to do it!!! When you have an opportunity to change it, get a fresh one."
Because covering your mouth with your outer elbow is difficult.
"Public appearances without mask should be treated as an offence. If anyone is shown not wearing a mask in television, print or social media, a statutory warning like ""Not wearing a mask is detrimental to human life"" or any other appropriate tagline  should be run with the image.  This should be similar to the warning ""Smoking is injurious to health"" that is carried with any smoking scene in a movie."
It is better to sneeze into your shirt/into your chest. There is no spraying of your fluids if you put it in your shirt. That's what I teach our kids.
"No, it is not under control. And, if you care to use Google or alternatively YouTube you should be able to find videos that demonstrate clearly how breath is distributed in the air - and thus the virus - with and without pressure. Quite obviously the more pressure is involved in the exhalation the further it is spread. In other words: wear the mask AND cough or sneeze into your armpit! And hope for the best, i.e. that people surrounding you will be as considerate."
We can't escape covid 19 because even if you wear masks you pull oxygen from out side and spread carbon dioxide out
It only costed a pandemic for people to learn to cover there mouths or wash  hands after going to the toliet simple hygiene practises amazing
"You all should be infected with COVID 19. Then as you lay drowning in fluid filling your lungs you will know how lovely it feels to drown in your own body. Perhaps it is not that important to save everyone. Maybe the intelligent, sensible people with brains not made out of marshmallow. I feel sorry for you. I really do."
"If they are travelling on public transport,they will be wearing a mask!! Nice to wear a snot filled mask!!"
Mask wearing should be made mandatory if only it can protect us from contact it .
He works for a private company. You see all the aircraft in museums and outside different places and the United States that's what all they do
"Nobody has the right to tell another how to live, what to wear! Have you seen those STARVING FAMILYS LIVING IN LITERAL GARBAGE, NO SHOES..ETC. They are not fearful their immune systems are strong, if they seen you people with masks on ,gloves hiding,  they'd laugh their heads off at you! f off with this crapping fear!"
"How much would it suck it cough and sneeze in a mask!! Your suppose to change the disposable mask every 30 mins! Who has at least 24 mask a day to use??!! Sorry maskless here and don't care! I will continue if need be to cough or sneeze into my elbow, and wash my hands. That is."
"""When used in conjunction with widespread testing, contact tracing, quarantining of anyone that may be infected, hand washing, aind physical distancing, face masks are a valuable tool to reduce community transmission. All of these measures, through their effect onR0 , have the potential to reduce the period of lockdown required."" (Howard et al 2020:6)"
I was taught to do this since I was old enough to walk. Didnt realize that the rest of society wasnt taught to do something so simple
Funny how the WHO recommendation is for healthy people to NOT wear masks.   AND they admit that asymptomatic people are not spreading this like they thought. (Very rare)  This is why so many of us are never going to live out your idiotic demands that we wear a mask.
"Where is this?? in New Jersey you cannot enter ANY  store, ANY means of public transportation without wearing a mask! No wonder why it's spreading like it is throughout the country. Us New Jerseyans are practicing staying at home except for essential  now that it's summer we are getting all these out-of-towners thrashing up our beaches like the spread of the  coronavirus  I hate to see what September is going to bring    When back-to-school doesn't happen"
"I’ve been coughing and sneezing into my shirt. I don’t really go in public much though, except to parks and grocery pickup (if that counts)."
"If anyone of us haven,t face mask or forgot to wear it when he / she is out of  home might have abruptly sneez or cough,  do it safely so that they do not feel inconvenience or insecure nearby you. Plz consider others health as well."
When was this put out I’m just shocked it’s even out. Lol reason being should just be able to sneeze since masks are great an suppose to be worn.
If we want to help we need laws about coughing not consideration.
"I feel coughing into a tissue and throwing it away then Saniztizer hands, Is much safer way. You are coughing up germs into clothes to then carry around with you."
WEAR A MASK. OUR LIVES DEPEND UPON IT.
Slowly slowly this disease is getting bigger. We have to protect ourselves and the safety of the other is also in our hands.
"Even when it's seasonal allergies not a virus cough and sneeze into elbow or Kleenex... I don't want to be spitting on people or vice versa, that's gross enough when my toddler does it never mind a stranger..."
"And What about the unconscious and ignorant people in our society that they really don't  care about  themselves, how will the idea of ​​covering the face during sneezing come to them and they basically do not believe this epidemic maybe covied_19 must be visible for them to believe just a lot of aware no more"
"In other words: When you feel like your nose needs to give an ""achoo"" Listen up close, this is what you do Raise your a up high, bend it toward your face And sneeze right *there*, in the bendy place"
"We were taught this as babies, why is it so difficult to understand this as adults ????? Cover your mouth."
It's like guy gobbling on the street as you walk bye? When I was 20 years old 30 years ago it was considered to be disgusting slob thing to do !  But its every where now!  Where has public respect gorn too?  Outer space I'd say
"Why isn’t anyone wearing Face masks, WHO I greatly appreciate all your work but there are so many people out there who don’t. You desperately need to get relate to ALL people, even the crazy radicals a rename would be a good start."
"I never go out anymore, I'm 69 with Diabetes, heart issues, Asthma, and  C.O.P.D..  luckily my daughter does my Grocery Shopping and picks up my Meds."
"Wait, I thought you said we needed to wear masks. So why do I need to cough in my elbow? Does the mask NOT filter out particles when you cough or sneeze?? Hmmm???"
"Omg the hate comments, and dictating to people are still flowing, hardest subject that people could ever learn In school, the minding their own business .."
Just wear a mask at all times if out of your own home!!!!
Show consideration by not following the WHO who are actually ran by a cult and use cult tactics to brainwash people
Its good habit to create. I sang in choir at church we were to do a concert and the director was adamant about coughing in the arm so no one get sick for concert. And no one got sick either! Sitting close together.
Maybe if people weren't such disgusting savages and followed these simple guidelines well before Covid we'd be in a different place.
1 meter social distancing is not enough. Considering that the corona virus could be an airborne disease. It should be at least 3 meters social distancing...
I need to cover their face with something if they can't afford mask get a scarf and cover your head if you're riding on a public system and keep your distance
Wear a MASK!!!!
main impact was due to  mask ......see proof in epidemic of 1919spanish flu on u tube
Shouldn't they all be wearing masks?
where are the passenger masks?
This is a consideration for ALL times - not just because of COVID!
"People, people. This image may have been made before Covid and the need for public to wear masks. Calm down. The message is be considerate to others when sneezing or coughing."
The manners of good mannering have gone down the toilet we are living in a broken world with disobedient people the sods.
"And provide a home for all those expelled germs .... to breed, multiply and infect others...."
And now everyone thinks they are safer by bumping elbows (that everyone is sneezing into) to stop the spread of a highly survivable virus.  You can't keep this mess straight.
"Wear a mask and social distance and stay away from the crowd if you are sick, better to stay home and don't spread the germs!!"
"BS... my wearing a mask MAINTAINS YOUR FREEDOMS & LIBERTIES!! It's called ALTRUISM OR SELFLESSNESS!! It's not politics, it NEVER was meant to be! Health Science, Anatomy & Physiology are NOT BASED in politics, they're grounded by FACTS!!  If I have COVID19 .. AND I CANNOT KNOW IF I DO W/O symptoms, I INSIST on preventing YOU from getting it FROM ME!!  I could NEVER sleep at night knowing I caused you & your family harm in any way, let alone my own wife & kids or extended family!!"
"Never understood that...  I can immediately sanitize my hands, so why walk around with contaminated sleeve ?"
Is this ad a joke? Wear a mask or face covering FFS! Stay home at the slightest symptom!
"satanists, they exposed themselves and cannot be trusted. People know the rules of hygiene without WHO silly posts"
WEAR A MASK IT IS EVEN BETTER!
I thought that a Wuhan flu mask was supposed to take care of this. I guess you finally admit that the Wuhan flu mask DOES NOTHING.
If people washed their hands and covered their faces like this we probably wouldn’t be in such a mess right now!
"Please make some good and informative illustrations, encourage everyone to use a mask"
Where are their masks??
People whom don’t want to wear a mask feel it’s their right and this is a control thing. Feel free to visit your local hospital and ask how many covid patients are admitted there. Before thinking this is a major joke.
Shouldn’t people on public transportation be wearing masks??
What a joke WHO  why do not you recommend people to wear a mask when you are outside.
Face masks should have a logo to understand why its important to where a mask               '4U - 4ME' I've been ridiculed for wearing one by youths in a shop (which I need to do)
Are we allowed to sneeze in public places ?
wasn't this the considerat and common sense thing to do before covid
"It's just another way of taking away our freedom, so that if we behave decently, with manners, consideration and common sense, having always done so anyway! But now we are doing it only because we've been ordered to. Grrrrr... An almighty affront against decent humanity and its destructive in its basic intention"
Mask up and still be courteous and sneeze or cough within the elbow... Common sense
I wear a mask at work i work out in the hot Heat bar 3 hours but I take a 15-minute lunch break and I type my mask off long enough to eat then I put my mask back on and go back outside and work for the rest of the time it's time for me to get off and I also wear it in public
Where are the cartoon characters' masks?
This is just a guess and I promise I didn't cheat by checking profiles. You are all from America  ??The land of trump and crap. Check your water supply because with so many affected by stupidity it has to be a man made poison. Perhaps trump has added disinfectant.
"Yes, meanwhile germs on your sleeve gets rubbed all over.  Think about it."
I will not that’s why I am forced to wear a mask!
Masks.....your mouth and nose should by covered by a mask if you are out in public especially on a bus!!!!
"Love thy neighbor applies to more than simply wearing a mask... try treating people with dignity and respect regardless of who and where you are. Best place to practice? The places you visit daily... the grocery store, the bank, etc... if they are implementing rules their jobs require in order to keep their job to feed their families? Read the signs, watch the news, catch up on policies before you go, don’t argue or jump all over them.. shut up and go about your business. Odds are they agree with you but they are do what is required of them. Period. Wanna be heard... November is on its way. Make you vote count."
Then great your friends by bumping elbows! Doesn’t make sense to me!!!
Wear a mask around your neck so you can cover when necessary!! It's not brain surgery!!
"I’m shocked the right wingers haven’t freaked out for telling them how to sneeze. It’s a free country, they will sneeze wherever they want!!!"
"Masks are useful to help stop the spread of our breathing reaching other people. We're protecting them.  Luckily, I live in WA where we've had the gov protect us from an invasion of the virus and consequently the stupidity of people who don't understand the need to wear them."
Police officers and their parking lots to make sure you don't cause any problems if you're not wearing a mess trying to come into their store
Common sense has gone astray. We did this long before the Covid-19 came into our world.
"the who is brought to fresh daily from china,,any questions,,,oh and the cdc well figure dont lie,,, here either but the figurers do LIE!!!! JUST CHECK THE NUMBERS COMING OUT OF FL. CDC REPORTS..."
Common sense!  We don't need the WHO!   I know how to stay healthy without any of your nonsense advice!
Where are the masks in this photo?  This is not your best public service message!  Lol Come on WHO....
People are supposed to be wearing masks on public transport so why are they not addressing that in the ad
It's out of respect whether it was COVID or not!
"Read carefuly this comment.  It's good way, better that to avoid gathering one place or buss  Always for taking masks is best  for preventive way to covid19."
Have known how to do this since the early 60’s.  If you were ever a waitress you learned this dah. Taught my kids too. Plus you can pull up the neckline of your shirt over your nose too.   Come on common sense
"And then they use those same arms to greet people, doesn't make sense. Taxis are 100% full ,no social distancing"
The WHO should show consideration to the world by disappearing.
"I don't  know why everyone is acting like washing hands , and  not sneezing or coughing on someone is a new concept"
Why isn't he using his mask? Apparently sneezing into your elbow is no longer political enough to use ! Although it WAS acceptable prior to Mar.
Lol omg like thats not normal safety & sanitation practices ...now stop w/the harmful excessive mask wearing
"We consider God in everyone who contributed to spreading this virus, spreading sedition, grief and fear in the hearts of people and contributed to the destruction of their lives. He is merely an inhuman, cowardly creature, stupid to a degree below the donkey."
It's considered to be polite to cough into tempo but respetless has forgotten what respect is
Wear a mask...some of us have trouble with this new cover thing. I cannot get my mouthin my elbow!
Just an observation... where are the essential face coverings x
Brookwood Inn South Carolina they were inspecting and it had live bombs in it the fire department and everybody came out to take care of it
They should have masks on when on public transport. That is mandatory on public transport in England.
Daily you are giving some stories...You will disappear after the this pandemic gone...And please don't come again.we are feared...
"Lee Magnusson 99.999 of the air is not contaminated. Thus, ignorance and idioticy is now the normal logic."
Your illustration should include masks. Why are none of the riders wearing them???
How about JUST WEAR A MASK!!!
Carry large handkerchieves and use one.
If we have to wear masks which making us is against the law then why must we still do this? I forgot the masks don’t work!
Why should someone be outside if posses cough and colds. It will cause panic to the people once they hear someone is sneezing or coughing. Better stay at home and cure first before going out.
They are doing it to keep the fear going
We need to protect ourselves from covid. Wearing a mask is essential now a days
I always pull my T-shirt Up over my nose/mouth when I sneeze if there are no tissues available to use.
This is for the good of others as well as yourself especially with viruses coughing and sneezing release particles in the atmosphere
"How about ""wear your f'ing mask"""
You should have a mask on when riding the bus in the first place
Thought they had to wear masks anyway !
"WHO as much credability as Mickey Mouse, sorry Mickey Mouse has more credability! WHO nothing but a gravy train! Useless!"
don’t very about corona... it’s just a normal flu.. corona is just a conspiracy by  Pharma companies and W H O ... so take  care and always believe and stay with our natural treatment .. Ayurveda and Naturopathy
Incredible how many adults still don't understand this.
Just wear a mask .. who wants other's sputtering ext all over them .. show some respect in this time to the old & vunrable & get over yourself for heavens sake
Shouldn't the WHO be recommending passengers not only to  keep their social distancing but also wear masks while travelling on public transport.
sneezing. I've seen it where people don't bother.
"Indeed, being considerate of others is the done thing during this crisis when it comes to coughing, sneezing, distancing and this sort of stuff."
They are wearing mask so what is the need to cover with elbow while coughing and sneezing.
And with a mask you inhale it back in ?  Sounds healthy
Won't share because of the mixed message. No mask shown on train or bus.  I believe they just screwed up on image.
"Regardless of the COVID19, I if I were a parent of a child under 12 and, like so many children, they didn’t cover their coughs or sneezes I’d make them wear a mask until they learned to cover their coughs and sneezes. I don’t know why the governments that stipulate people have to wear masks have an exemption for children under twelve citing they don’t know how to wear one. No one knows how to wear one properly until taught."
I love it when my kids tells me the child next to them goes to school sick and coughs with their mouth open. Lifestyle habits start at home
"What stupid!!! Why not wear Mask?!!!   Thé moment you got tot cough, it is not always possible tot cover your mouth! Please wear Mask !!!"
People really need to be told to cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing!!
I think people are getting tired of your inconsistent messaging. This is really not helpful.
To be safe and confident enough it's. Better to cover our nose and mouth when in public
Pathetic. It actually isn’t about your rights ; it is about the health of your nation and fellow Americans. Hope you are proud of yourself. Your rich country has one of the worst outcomes in the world due to fools like you and you leaderless country. All those deaths! And Florida groaning under all their cases
Bad one non Masked  elbow is also bad cause one may  come in contact with droplets through elbow greet
The real problem is the lack of windows. Buses should be made with bigger windows which facilitate the renewal of air inside.
BS. Your shirt collar works much better. Just pull it up cover your nose please
Better to sneeze into your elbow than a mask and keeping the mask on rest of the day.
What to be REALLY considerate of others ... wear a mask!
In Luxembourg all passengers are obliged to wear a protective mask!
Yes this habits are  vital not only for this pandemic but also    for all the time to avoid any viral infections.
Don’t need the WHO to tell me how ton be considerate of others when sneezing.
"The most disgusting things is to sneeze in your elbow. Ladies often wear their bags there, men touch that part of their arm with their hand and they all infect others that way. Not to talk about those who don't wash their clothes each day."
What if you have a mask on.  This doesn’t make sense!
But everyone on public transport had to wear a mask and presumably sneeze into that’s?
"Yeah, but what have you done to stop the spread? You knew about this last year but said and did nothing. Now that you stand to make money from us all, you are dictating what we all do. So in the words of John Wick"
What about sneezing properly into one's tissue?
If we have to keep reminding people about how to cough then there parents and TEACHERS did a piss poor job
"“Show consideration for other passengers. If you need to cough or sneeze, make sure you cover your mouth with your inner elbow COVID-19.” especially while wearing a mask."
Looks like his smelling his armpit which in some cases are more deadlier than this pandemic.
Yes must be with mask in public place.  Not like all ANC and they stupid government was on Zinzi Mandela funeral and no one have a mask. Disgusting.  They do not follow their own rules.
If this virus is so contagious why are masks and all items that risk coming in contact with it .  Not disposed of as clinical waste.
"You can't make me cover my mouth when I cough or sneeze, that's taking away my freedom!"
Wear a mask! Please and Thank you!
Should wear a sugical mask anywhere in this time of pandemic!
Even though a mask cover cough or sneeze
These passengers need masks! Quick get the sharpie!
"Thanks to the World Health Organization advice is certainly an important one.  There is another way to escape from the Covid 19, such as having to think about how to disinfect the car seats with a completely clean Savlon."
"WHO you’re behind time, masks are now mandatory on public transport almost everywhere"
A mask would be better and go with your other guidelines
Thank you! I enjoy the messages posted on here. Ignore the sarcasm on here. Some people DO need to be told...still
Where are the masks?! Is this a joke?!
Is this now in a bus How cost effective will it be if so little people are in a bus or taxi How will the health workers go to work
This just in from the WHO: look both ways when you cross the street!
better... if you are sick... stay home... if you are sneezing or coughing.... stay home.... don't get on that bus.... stay home....
There a whole group on Facebook dedicated to people who refuse to wear masks cause they don’t want to feel controlled But tell black Americans to “get over slavery”and that “All lives matter “😂😂let the virus do what it needs to for people who feel this way lmaooooo
"But if you're already wearing a mask, wouldn't elbow coverage smear some particles on your inner elbow from the mask?"
I know it annoys me have been wearing mine since the beginning it's no big deal and it could save your life and other people's
"If I'm masked, do I still need to do this? Asking for a friend."
Don't forget the disposable gloves & disinfect your hands when you get home to keep the germs away
Again... inconsistent messages... what happened to masks in public enclosed places??... come on WHO!!!
"Mary, I would point a finger directly at your, UK, government before I complained about an ad presented by WHO.   WHO is a “global” organization whose messaging must reflect the overall response to the pandemic not the specific. Thank you for reading."
you probably lost most people at 'show consideration'
I've been covering my mouth when I sneezed or coughed sense I was 3.
WHO:In public transport mask not necessary but hijab is mandatory.
"If this virus has shown us anything, it's that far too many people don't know how to sneeze or wash their hands correctly"
Or better still WEAR a Mask!
If you have a mask on you don’t have to worry about that.
Make sure you're wearing a mask.
I do like this and also cover with my under t-shirt like mask. Always i do.
Coughing and sneezing in a mask on my face? That’s all kind of unhealthy.
Why isn’t everyone wearing a mask on the bus. Mixed message from WHO.
"If you’re not wearing a mask, stay at home. !!"
Everyone knows this since ages.  You close your shop and rest will be fine.
I found out last night that if you smoke and drink you can't spread the virus. Or at least that was the impression left by the casino staff that required everyone to wear masks except when smoking and drinking.  I even heard an employee threaten to call security on a person that did not have his mask on and was not smoking or drinking.  Is it possible that science has discovered that exhaled tobacco smoke and alcoholic beverages prevent the spread of the virus?
This is for those without a face covering.
We taught this to our kids in kindergarten at school.
My husband debated me for years because I'd call him out on his hand-sneezing. He'd pull up  BS article after article stating it was ok. I laughed. All written by men.
You should be wearing a mask.
Isn’t it a joke that WHO posted this “reminder” an hour ago? Are you guys living in another planet?
so people  out there think about others  Family life  love  one more life dose matter
that too!
Better yet... WEAR YOUR FREAKING MASK!!!
Is this a lesson for small children?  Nope and where are the
Yes sneeze into your own mask...hope its not a snotty sneeze or your screwed
This is so simplistic it is essentially useless--and maybe even dangerous in the midst of a pandemic.  Where are their masks?
I SAY it would make more sense to cough towards the shoulder. It completely cuts off the spread.  Particles can still go underneath the lower inner arm if done your way.
"WEAR A MASK, first and foremost!!!"
World criminal organisation is what u should be called. Pedo lovers in bed with gates
You should have been doing this before covid-19!!
"Let us pull together, to adhere to rules and regulations provided by (WHO)to fight this pandemic please!!!!Let God be our hope as we pull hands together."

People in this pic should have been wearing masks
How many years we should cough this position any idea????

Why doesn’t the image depict passengers wearing masks??????
"How about leading by example, WHO, and have the bus passengers wearing face masks...."
So many PEOPLE from the US winning about WHO showing an image where the characters are not wresting masks. As if people from that country even listens to them. US is the ONLY country in the world that has people stupid enough to start a protest against wearing masks.   Might as well protest car manufacturers to stop putting seat belts and airbags in cars while you're at it.
how about a images where they are wearing a mask on public transit !!
Why don't they have masks on.  Public transportaion and no mask.  Yuck.
nd people are acting as if it’s all new
Maybe they should be wearing masks....
.i though it was mandatory??
"Unfortunately if you’re wearing a mask, like we told to do, sneezing would be inside it..."
Instead Use N95 or N99 mask in public places
Inner elbow?? Germs still get past it. How come we don't sneeze inside our shirts no more.?
#Boycott China &  WHO
Just wear a mask!!!
Wearing of nose mask in public places should be made compulsory no matter your religious belief or your social status.

Glad they clarified using the inner elbow.  Bloody hard to use the outer.
WEAR A MASK...AS SIMPLE AS THAT...
I have trouble getting my elbow up to my mouth to stop the cough but I certainly try
I see people wearing mask take them off just to sneeze and cough. How bout tell people that's what it's for!
What’s wrong with WHO? Messages that confuse everyone. People should be wearing masks as WHO advise.
What about when kids go back to school And busses are packed- standing room only? It sure doesn’t look like this bus ride.....
Very confusing. They say the covid 19 iis.spread mostly from facial cavities E G mouth and nose.What correct mask materials to use to minimize the spread of covid 19 ¿

DIDN'T trump defund them?
"Can you add ""In addition to a mask"" to this and update the image accordingly?   We're already stupid enough here in the U.S. to have millions of selfish jerks who won't. They don't need to be encouraged further.  It's nice, though, that businesses are getting the message and there will be few places they can congregate to blow their funk all over each other. The Walmart mask policy starts today and boy, they're fired up about it! Imagine thinking that shopping at Walmart unmasked is something they truly believe is a constitutional right"
"***TRUMPERS*** You don't believe in science and facts, so why are you on this page?   Do you really think you're going to change anything?"




They tell things we know
Not in all UK

No mask?
"We need to be considerate to others which can lead to a happy outcome. If we feel unwell, we stay at home and take care of ourselves so that others will be safe. Stay safe. Lets be our brothers keeper. Very soon they will teach us how to wear masks and nose covers"

"Do you not think humans outside of your cult can't think for themselves? Idk about you, but I was taught to always cover my mouth when coughing or sneezing and then wash my hands if at all possible after doing so."

U desception will come to an end now nd u all won't escap the Sword of the Lord that are using covid-19 to imprisoned people

"the longer people wear masks and social distance and stay quarantined,  the more their immune system weakens and then there WILL BE a mass amount of deaths."
Snot all over your sleeve

I SAY GRIP.GRIP.GRIP AND DO SOMTHING ABOUT IT IF U CAN
"Sorry but I call Bull on sneezing on arm sleeves. That crap is now stuck to you. Every hug you give, spreads germs. Hankies or throw away tissues is the CORRECT way to sneeze, cough without spreading it."
Final year students ko promote kiya jaye
"As for me i keep all the instrotion and am using this time to all those who don,t belive that is real to no is real ooo"
Please do not believe the SOUTH AFRICAN  COVID STATISTICS . ITS ALL FALSE... TO GET MONEY FROM WHO ..
"I thought you had to wear mask on public transport so you should be coughing and sneezing into it, I was also taught from a young age to cover my mouth when coughing and sneezing preferably in a tissue.I also carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer."
What about farting?
"All the human beings in this bus are Muslims, because all of them wearing a Muslim hijab outfits."
LOL. STFU China's puppet.
wearing masks
"This pandemic thing is one big lie. And covering mouth when you coughing and nose when you sneezing is something what all we need to do always, not because they said is pandemic."
"I thought in the UK it was mandatory to wear face coverings on Public Transport.  I went on a bus today in Kingston upon Thames and at least half of the people were not wearing a mask, and probably half of those who were didn't have their nose covered. How come WHO has this message with people on a bus NOT wearing masks? To wear one shows respect for others, please get the message out loud and clear.  It does help to wear a face covering."
"I thought masks were supposed to take care of that. Aren’t we all supposed to be wearing masks? Are you telling me that people outside the United States aren’t wearing masks? And if everyone except the United States has this virus under control, why does it matter where you cough or sneeze? It shouldn’t. Because the virus is under control. Right?"
"If you’re on public transportation wear a mask. There is no excuse not to wear one anymore, not any legitimate ones w/exception of true medical waiver. Anyone not wearing one must simply conclude to themselves, that they don’t care about their fellow human"
Don't need to be told how to live from a private organization saying they want to come into my house and quarantine my children separate from me

Great advice but has anyone one else notice some ppl will wear mask and when they're talking with someone they pull the mask from their mouth and pull it back up when finish.. a great way to be inconsiderate and pass the virus. And the elbow sneezing am not to sure about that cause you will be passing in crowd and touching other ppl and that droplet can pass on to other that get in contact . Cause the virus remain on surface clothes etc. Keeping a tissue or a rag is a great way then dispose of it..
Glad to see nobody has a mask on!
regarding stem of the spread of the corona COVID-19 virus.
"I usually just sneeze into the women’s underwear on my face, so that the germs and dirt that my body was trying to expel sit on my face and just get forced back inside me"
Very strange for me!!! In my country people get infected in huge numbers while wearing masks and staying home. Eg Doctors get it yet mask are worn every time...
.. and wipe it round the pole when the bus stops suddenly or you are avoiding touching the pole with your hands trying not to be catapulted to the windscreen or out of the door. It defies belief the ignorance that some have of travelling on public transport. Anyone getting fed up of  being treated like a leper yet? The psychological manipulation  is frankly astounding especially the unbelievable delay in identifying how virus spread and even what a virus is!
"More is expected of an organization with the mission of establishing world health standards in a pandemic. More consistency, and a more cohesive and viable public narrative on world health right now."
Can’t catch covid for trying been round covid positive people and I have bad asthma and in late 50s so it not that bad it’s all about money and government controlling its citizens in my opinion
Wear a mask on public transportation should be mandatory!
And wear a mask on public transit.
"TTC is s nightmare.. last week i was on it for at least 2.5 hours and half the trip was somewhat ok with 60 percent wearing masks, and others just doing whatever.  The way back was a nightmare of over crowding, no masks, large groups, no seating or standing room either and trying to keep people a meter away was impossible.  I was very stressed. When you hit high density areas or connections, all hell broke loose.  I heard they were giving out masks one day. Doesnt help unless you wear them. I literally had to put my feet on the seat beside me to stop people from sitting there. Even if you try, someone can sit right behind you and be about 4 inches from your head and cough the whole time if they like. It was nuts."
"The director of the CDC made an extraordinary claim this week that shouldn’t be overlooked.  If we all wear masks, COVID-19 is controlled in 4-8 weeks.  More studies report MASKS WORK.  Wouldn’t that be great !!!    #VoteBlue"
Why has it taken a pandemic for people to realize they should not be sneezing into open air
"World Health Organization (WHO) this is sabotage!!!! How are u helping us (health professionals) with this kind of announcements?  ""Cover your mouth with your inner elbow""??? Really now?  When all this time we are trying to convince them to wear a MASK???!!!"
"I think the inner knee is a much better place to cough. A lot of people grab others by the arm to get their attention,thus spreading the virus. If you are wearing a mask & cough...would you suggest the mask be immediately taken off or does the mask retain all the germs so you are the only one breathing them?"
"Btw.: where I live, we wear masks. No, we do not like it either. But we like Corona even less. If you care to check our daily infections, JHU has them."
"‪We report that how many people get Covid-19 daily, it’s a important data, but not a critical data.                   some of them are as normal and no need to see doctor, could work and do whatever activities they want.    the critical data shall be how many people need to stay in hospital for medical treatment . ‬"
"Stupidity runs rampant in the U.S.A. I know alot of people are outraged by the new mask law but let's say you woke up with a terrible cough, a fever, and severe body aches. Immediately, you rush to the doctor and unfortunately, you’re diagnosed with COVID-19. For the last two weeks, you’ve been unaware that you were infected and you’ve ignored ""the rules."" You've gotten together with some close friends for pizza, had a few people over, even visited a park and a beach. You figured, “I don’t feel sick. I have the right to keep living my normal life. No one can tell me what to do."" With your diagnosis, you spend the next few days at home on the couch, feeling pretty crappy; but then you’re well again because you’re young, healthy and strong. Lucky you. But your best friend caught it from you during a visit to your house, and because she didn't know she was contagious, she visited her 82-year-old grandfather, who uses oxygen tanks daily to help him breathe because he has COPD and heart failure. Now, he’s dead. Your co-worker, who has asthma, caught it too, during your little pizza get-together. Now, he’s in the ICU, and he's spread it to a few others in his family, too--but they won't know that for another couple of weeks yet.ed coma and intubated; she may not get to say goodbye to her loved ones. She may die surrounded by machines, with no family at her bedside. All because you couldn't stand the inconvenience of a mask; of staying home; of changing your familiar routines for just a little while. Because you have the right, above all others rights, to continue living your normal life and no one, I mean no one, has the right to tell you what to do.   = It’s not about YOU!  = It's not about YOU!  = It's not about YOU!  = It's not about YOU!  = It's not about YOU!  = It's not about YOU!"
e you should educate yourself and quit wasting  our time. You are pathetically ignorant.

This should be basic human knowledge and behavior. Don’t be a jerk. Cover your face!
Why did you PREVENT DOCTORS TO USE IBUPROFEN this DELIBERATE MISTAKE COST THOUSANDS OF LIVES...you covered up until  ITALY DISCOVERED that IBUPROFEN was EFFECTIVE TO SAVE LIVES you ‘WHO’ SILENTLY DETRACTED from your INTENTIONAL LIE—The “WHO” has BLOOD ON Their HANDS
"If possible,we should all avoid breathing altogether,it seems to be the cause of all our problem."
A sneeze can travel 26 feet. So just scrap the busses. Sneeze particles can also penetrate any mask. So scrap masks. Oh and has covid been isolated and purified yet? If so please send me proof.
"This should be common etiquette at any time, not just during corona."

By inhaling the steam of eucalyptus leaves or oil for 'COVID-19' can decrease the 'DEATH RATE' by improving the respiratory system.  (we can save many lives) Eucalyptus is also very helpful to avoiding other symtoms of 'COVID-19'. Please test it.
To future historians: these comments should explain all the virus deaths.
You World Health Organization people need to f—- sort yourselves out before you start telling us what to do
"""Show consideration for other countries. If the CCP lies or covers things up, make sure you open your mouth with your few remaining ethics and tell the other countries about the CCP Virus (COVID-19)."""
They covered it up and let the virus spread to the world now they are pretending to be helpers
Masks only serve one purpose and that is to show you can be completely controlled

I'm sorry trump has brainwashed so many into believing that WHO and the CDC are not relevant for the times we live in!!! I guess beans and statues are more important!!!
"Masks do nothing. A virus is a lot smaller than the pores in that slave muzzle you call a mask.  If masks work, then why cough into your elbow?"
Wear your mask
Wear a mask !so many people are not doing this.
WHAT IF THOSE THINGS DONT SOLVE ANY BROBLEM? I HAVE A LASTING SOLUTION TO THE CORONA VIRUS
Where are their masks??? WHO whats the message
OMG PUT MASKS ON THEM YOU IDIOTS. Waiting for peer reviewed studies (which now exist anyway) is madness in a situation with a novel virus. Recommend what works on other viruses!
Where are their masks????????
"For anyone questioning is Covid-19 being used by the global elites to bring about a New World Order (NWO) then I suggest you sit back and with no bias watch this interview.  The last video Spiros did, which exposed ""forced mandatory vaccines in a state of emergency"" was pulled down  by You Tube as they're censoring all truth!!  But it's available on Bitchute.   But in thus video it's pretty obvious the elites are using the Covid-con to bring about a one world Government.  Face Book can't ""fact check"" censor this as it's the truth.   WAKE UP BEFORE ITS TOO LATE - DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE"
"WHO really think they can control people in the world, we'll the anc terrorists cabal in South Africa, their supports hold parties, drink alcohol that the evil anc regime banned, they also banned cigarettes, whilst citizens buy alcohol & cigarettes from the black market, they get sick dome in hospital,  now the anc punish the whole country, bcoz it is incompetent to enforce lockdown rules to its own supporters  WE are not children they need to go and teach all those who live in shacks as they don't care too hoot about the virus and the rules, whilst the anc regime, and it's officials is looting the relief funds meant for covid programmes , and to buy PPE'S Police shot dead 2 and arrested 7 at Joburg airport  , to steal PPE'S,  billions already missing, pple bought luxury cars to the tune of R11 million , range Rover Lamborghini and expensive BMW cars, whilst 20 million citizens or more & kids starve daily, anc cllrs even steal food parcels for their friends & family, millions 3 million and counting lost their jobs, can you see this massive civil up rising, TIME WILL TELL = WHO NOBODY BELIEVE IN YOU ANYMORE, SAVE TIME & CLOSE OFFICE PERIOD"
using masks is dangereous voor the person who wears them...
Stop being a conceited jerk and put a mask on!
You've all lost it open it up it's a shim sham 99.999999 9 no death it's a shim sham it's a Democrat virus

"incter.  Human beings have been breathing each others breath (Manna) intentionally since time immemorial This practice is part of a spiritual culture and it is done without fear of being infected or infecting others from secretions. They have complete faith in the good lord above and their immune system to protect them and others from Natural viral droplets. If Covid-19 is a biological weapon made by my enemy, I doubt a paper mask shall ever protect me.  of wearing masks..."
"n, states that at these markets, “The cages are stacked one over another. Animals at the bottom are often soaked with all kinds of liquid. Animal excrement, pus, blood.” Such conditions allow viruses to spread from one animal to another as well as to humans who come into contact with them. All such markets are potential breeding grounds for zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19, SARS, and MERS.   © Jo-Anne McArthur / We Animals  Just as we don’t want to be infected with the novel coronavirus or die from COVID-19, other animals don’t want to suffer or be slaughtered for food. Yet billions of chickens alone are killed for their flesh or exploited for their eggs each year, despite being sensitive, intelligent individuals who use more than 30 types of vocalizations to communicate about various threats approaching. And mother hens gently cluck to their chicks before they hatch."
"Go ahead deprive yourself of enough oxygen. Go ahead breath back in your partly expelled CO2. Go ahead breath back in your bacteria. Go ahead & cause yourself future respiratory problems. Go ahead and look like a sheep that hasn't used their brain. Also, you people are even more stupid if you think your face nappy stops infection, bacteria or a virus. Your only causing yourself personal harm to your health. Your not saving the world."
