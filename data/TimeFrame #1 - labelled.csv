they also need to wear a mask so they can protect others from the sleeve full of germs he will pass around to others on the bus.,2,,,
Why is the WHO not encouraging mask wearing... we had this message before and the virus is still spreading,1,,,
And who will believe an Organization that has permitted to chair a person from the Country where Covid started? Where are the case studies that mask works?  Why wait 8 months after temps have reached into the mid 90's and higher to FORCE us to wear masks? Your breathing in more Carbon Dioxide than Oxygen along with your sweat and bacteria that is trapped in your mask.,1,,,

And passengers also don't hate those sneeze( with precautions) it's a natural process....,4,,,
I thought all of these people were supposed to be wearing a mask?  What happened to that?  Or was that just last week?,1,,,
"WEAR A MASK! SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IF EVERYONE WEARS A MASK, WE COULD NEARLY ELIMINATE THE VIRUS!",1,,,
This is NOT a new concept! The WHO seems to be trying to be relevant.,1,,,
WEAR A MASK unless you want society sheltering in place for all eternity!!!,1,,,
I can’t understand why people should sneeze into their elbow rather than a disposable tissue. When I see people doing the elbow nudge I do think to myself  - germs - passing from person to person!,1,,,
just like we do in Holland.,3,,,
WEAR A MASK on public transit!,3,,,
"If possible,  we should all avoid breathing altogether,  it seems to be the cause of all our problems!!!",1,,,
"Hannah Sellers   they eased off on their mask chat then?  funny thing is I read someone comment about wearing a mask to sneeze into! It’s your body clearing it’s self out and she’s suggesting we all suck that back in. Common sense tells us to cover a sneeze this way anyway, or with a tissue, handkerchief if you have one to hand.",4,,,
Luv reading the neurotic commentary below.  Telling folks how to sneeze and how to live their life. Interesting,1,,,

"And yes, do this even when you’re wearing a mask",3,,,
"This should be common etiquette at any time, not just during a pandemic!",3,,,
What a laugh they're not even wearing masks in this advert after we've all been told wee have to. If anyones got a cough or cold they should not be out at all let alone on London transport..,1,,,
Every one should wear mask also for effective  protection.,3,,,
"It's too bad hospital beds go to these people when they get sick. Mask wearers first, non-mask wearers last. Just saying.",1,,,
"Take a tablet of hydroxy chloroquine every morning, it is a prophylactic medication that prevents covid.",3,,,
It means without masks we can survive,4,,,
You should always cover when coughing or sneezing. Not just now. No one ever wanted to have any one else’s germs on them. Duh!,3,,,
"Pretty sad people still need to be told how to cough and sneeze! Sorry but I don’t need the CDC, WHO or the government to tell me how to practice good hygiene and to be considerate of others.",1,,,
What about coughing into your mask and then breathing in your own germs...asking for a friend...,2,,,
"There are still people that think masks make them choke in their own carbon dioxide even though this is not true, they still think they shouldn’t have to wear them if they aren’t sick because they don’t understand that Covid can be asymptomatic.. WHO and CDC need to start a campaign and blast social media debunking this.",2,,,
Why the hell don’t these people have masks on!,1,,,
"coughing etc, but no mention of masks.",2,,,
Better still  WEAR A MASK,3,,,
Let's show some consideration to the Ethiopians that the director of the WHO personally tortured to death while working with the Communist party there.,1,,,
"why did you do an ad with the characters not wearing a mask  - and yes besides wearing a mask in public transport you can still also make sure you cough or sneeze into your elbow, heck anything extra helps - helps you helps others",2,,,
We have learned a lot more due to COVID19  COVID19 is real and dangerous  How many people get flu every year..... because we never cover coughs and wear masks So wear your mask and cover your cough. Stay 2m apart from other people Do you hear people die?,3,,,
"Good advice! And wear a mask, better advice! I encourage positivity here, to all folks of the world! Not wearing a mask could mean you and others get sick. Your child, or your parents; people more vulnerable. It can't hurt you to wear a mask. Proud Canadian mask wearer and social distancer!",4,,,
"I know this will get lost in the comments but sometimes I like to go into the backyard, lay in the garden, then cover myself with dirt & pretend I'm a carrot.",3,,,
Everyone always say where a mask. But now they say you don't have to when you vote. HELLO..... This is all about politics. Swim in water parks and pools but can't get a book from the library and no gym and no movie and eat in a restaurant but not fast food restaurant. Some churches have only outside service. Just government telling us how to live.,1,,,
Perhaps if common sense was taught in school instead of common core we would not have half of the problems society is experiencing...,1,,,
Keep spray hand sanitizer if you need to cough or sneeze cover your mouth with your inner elbow. Spray hand sanitizer on inner elbow after sneezing or coughing.,3,,,
I hope you weren't successful and passed it on to someone at risk...,3,,,
"You know what occured to me the other day? If you cough into your elbow - then do elbow bumps with someone (or more) at a meeting...then they cough into their elbow,                their mouth is very near to the germs that were on your elbow and touched his   jacket!!",2,,,
"Even if the art is older than the recent change of advice about masks, masks can be easily added with photoshop.  It is misleading to show the interior of a bus where passengers are not wearing masks!   Please, please, please change the art. This is serious.",1,,,
Oh my...It's a cartoon people. Everyone should know by now that in confined spaces and transit masks are good practice.  Although A+ for identifying it.,3,,,
Everybody I see coughing or sneezing does it into their hands. Nobody has common sense these days,2,,,
This command of wearing mask should be changed to cover your noes and mouth. Some are fulfilling righteousness of wearing mask. They cover their chin. Some take it up to the forehead,2,,,
WHO showing people without masks in a public transport? Outrageous!,1,,,
I worked n a hospital we just pulled our uniform neck open and coughed into the inside.  Because your arms are bare it worked better for us.,3,,,
This used to be common courtesy taught to all children 2 years old and older. Manners need to be taught at home and not left to WHO to teach adults with posters!,1,,,
Where are their masks?  I thought it is now mandatory on public transport in most countries.  (And of course always cover your mouth coughing or sneezing whatever the reason.),2,,,
"You should give this advice: « hey man, just make sure to say: « sorry guys! » » It would be the same...",1,,,
Why are your advertisement characters without mouth cover .,2,,,
Laughing stock. The WHO are idiots. Would be better to tell people to use tissues NOT their sleeves,1,,,
"Mask requirements are not working and people are not wearing them. No matter what article I read, no one is discussing the REAL reason for mask which is to SLOW the spread so that hospitals have the room and supplies to treat everyone.  It's like no one get it at all  even tho it's been explained over and over and over.",2,,,
"If you need to tell grow adults to do that, I think we have an issue.",2,,,
Yes so definitely true obey the rules that the government's set out for all of us to stay safe. And to stop the spread so to each and everyone else ppl's obey and stick with these rules,4,,,
We have received several ICU patients. Who decided to hang around covid positive people to get “ herd immunity “. Hey guys keep it up. I need the job security.  The morgue guy is also getting a lot more work.  Thank you to all the people not wearing masks. We are getting a lot of mandatory overtime. I am getting a lot of muscles proning and rolling patient s to keep them alive. Keep it up and there will be no one left to vote for your supreme leader,1,,,
Why has it taken a pandemic for people to realize they should not be sneezing into open air,2,,,
"That's just common courtesy, it should always have been that way. It's called manners.",3,,,
"Or...you can carry Kleenex with you at all times. I do. If I have enough warning that a cough or sneeze is coming on, I pull out a Kleenex and use it. This saves me from spewing my germs onto my clothes.  Good idea to carry with you a little bottle of hand sanitizer, too. We should clean our hands after using a Kleenex. Hand sanitizer is good when you can’t wash your hands.",3,,,
No problem if you already have a mask on. As you should travelling on public transport,3,,,
The rule everywhere should be to wear a mask on public transportation!,3,,,
Why you shouldn’t touch elbows instead of handshakes.,,,,
"All you should  know people is that we've  to follow the five preventive  measures  wash hand regularly, physical distancing, sneeze en cough in th folded elbow,  use hand sanitizer  and no hand shakes. Mask up in th crowded  places now every one  is aware of these the WHO was trying to show us on how sit in public and also how to cough and sneeze",,,,
Unfortunately personal hygiene has gone out the window. The amount of people I’ve seen walk straight out of toilets and not wash their hands is horrendous. So basically they have to be reminded to wash their hands.,1,,,
", only sick people should wear a mask. But if it makes you feel better, ok. Don’t hassle people who aren’t sick and choose freedom over a muzzle.",3,,,
"it would be much more accurate to use tissue paper, if not, how naturally it sneezes should be (head down by tilting between two knees). If you sneezed into your elbow, where did the droplets from your body remain? On your dress. Then you tied your arms and your hand touched the area you sneezed. Then you got stuck somewhere. Then someone else grabbed the same place. Let's say you are wearing a short sleeve dress, how will you sneeze into your elbow? It has to be smart and logical. When people sneeze, their heads and necks are leaning towards the ground and sneezing with a high pressure, and the droplets from sneezing do not fly into the air. People are created like this.",3,,,
What is a big joke is a face shield. Virus can easily get in and out. People wear them only so they don't get in trouble for not having a face covering. WHO does say only people that should be wearing a mask are working in the medical field and caring for the sick and people that have bad health issues and low immune system. I had a customer pass out in front of her 10 year old son and her son took off his mask and threw it on the ground. How do you think he will act at school when he sees his mom passed out in front of him. Two days later they came back and the son was clinging to his mom. A guy passed out wearing one while driving and crashed into a pole. Not everyone can tolerate wearing one especially if never wore one ever in their lives.,2,,,
"So sad that grown adults are just now learning basic, proper hygiene.  Glad I’m a responsible parent that actually teaches my children manners...my four year old always sneezes into his elbow, but other grown family members were apparently never taught this",2,,,
"Sad that the CDC is actually having to put put reminders for something that should be basic manners.. I was doing this stuff since 5 years old. ""Cover your mouth!"" If I didnt I got in trouble. Like is basic manners and hygiene not a thing anymore? Must not be.",1,,,
"has nothing to do with compliance, it is about caring enough about your grandmother and grangfather and parents to keep them safe. hope your family thinks you are special in light of you not thinking they are special",2,,,
elbow not safe.,2,,,
I thought you require all to wear a Mask. It’s much safer to sneeze or cough with your mask on than sneeze with your elbow with no mask. In the picture all are not wearing mask. Very dangerous if the virus linger in the air for 3 hours.,1,,,
"Um....why would they need to do that when they have a mask on to stop all that spray?? Tired of the changing narratives. So, no masks needed on public transportation so long as you use your manners and cover your sneeze appropriately?",1,,,
"To most of the brainwashed people on here thinking that wearing those cheap mask helps protect you from viruses newsflash they don't. My son's friends mum is a nurse, and they wear a special type of fitted mask.  These mask which surgeons and nurses wear are completely different to the ones you see people outside wearing.",2,,,
"Also, don't bully someone if they cough or sneeze. Some of us have allergies and other reasons why we cough and sneeze, not COVID-19 related. Yes, I wear a mask, and yes I cough and sneeze into my elbow. I've also been stared at and approached rudely because I've sneezed and coughed due to allergies. I had my mask on when this happened. Please don't jump to conclusions, and don't bully each other.",3,,,
Tissue paper and handkerchiefs do not exist in the world of WHO? And where are the face masks?? And then you go to the office with your arms full of ...erh...,1,,,
"Cough into your mask and do NOT pull it down to do it!!! When you have an opportunity to change it, get a fresh one.",1,,,
Because covering your mouth with your outer elbow is difficult.,3,,,
"Public appearances without mask should be treated as an offence. If anyone is shown not wearing a mask in television, print or social media, a statutory warning like ""Not wearing a mask is detrimental to human life"" or any other appropriate tagline  should be run with the image.  This should be similar to the warning ""Smoking is injurious to health"" that is carried with any smoking scene in a movie.",2,,,
It is better to sneeze into your shirt/into your chest. There is no spraying of your fluids if you put it in your shirt. That's what I teach our kids.,3,,,
"No, it is not under control. And, if you care to use Google or alternatively YouTube you should be able to find videos that demonstrate clearly how breath is distributed in the air - and thus the virus - with and without pressure. Quite obviously the more pressure is involved in the exhalation the further it is spread. In other words: wear the mask AND cough or sneeze into your armpit! And hope for the best, i.e. that people surrounding you will be as considerate.",2,,,
We can't escape covid 19 because even if you wear masks you pull oxygen from out side and spread carbon dioxide out,3,,,
It only costed a pandemic for people to learn to cover there mouths or wash  hands after going to the toliet simple hygiene practises amazing,2,,,
"You all should be infected with COVID 19. Then as you lay drowning in fluid filling your lungs you will know how lovely it feels to drown in your own body. Perhaps it is not that important to save everyone. Maybe the intelligent, sensible people with brains not made out of marshmallow. I feel sorry for you. I really do.",2,,,
"If they are travelling on public transport,they will be wearing a mask!! Nice to wear a snot filled mask!!",1,,,
Mask wearing should be made mandatory if only it can protect us from contact it .,3,,,
He works for a private company. You see all the aircraft in museums and outside different places and the United States that's what all they do,1,,,
"Nobody has the right to tell another how to live, what to wear! Have you seen those STARVING FAMILYS LIVING IN LITERAL GARBAGE, NO SHOES..ETC. They are not fearful their immune systems are strong, if they seen you people with masks on ,gloves hiding,  they'd laugh their heads off at you! f off with this crapping fear!",3,,,
"How much would it suck it cough and sneeze in a mask!! Your suppose to change the disposable mask every 30 mins! Who has at least 24 mask a day to use??!! Sorry maskless here and don't care! I will continue if need be to cough or sneeze into my elbow, and wash my hands. That is.",4,,,
"""When used in conjunction with widespread testing, contact tracing, quarantining of anyone that may be infected, hand washing, aind physical distancing, face masks are a valuable tool to reduce community transmission. All of these measures, through their effect onR0 , have the potential to reduce the period of lockdown required."" (Howard et al 2020:6)",3,,,
I was taught to do this since I was old enough to walk. Didnt realize that the rest of society wasnt taught to do something so simple,2,,,
Funny how the WHO recommendation is for healthy people to NOT wear masks.   AND they admit that asymptomatic people are not spreading this like they thought. (Very rare)  This is why so many of us are never going to live out your idiotic demands that we wear a mask.,1,,,
"Where is this?? in New Jersey you cannot enter ANY  store, ANY means of public transportation without wearing a mask! No wonder why it's spreading like it is throughout the country. Us New Jerseyans are practicing staying at home except for essential  now that it's summer we are getting all these out-of-towners thrashing up our beaches like the spread of the  coronavirus  I hate to see what September is going to bring    When back-to-school doesn't happen",2,,,
"I’ve been coughing and sneezing into my shirt. I don’t really go in public much though, except to parks and grocery pickup (if that counts).",3,,,
"If anyone of us haven,t face mask or forgot to wear it when he / she is out of  home might have abruptly sneez or cough,  do it safely so that they do not feel inconvenience or insecure nearby you. Plz consider others health as well.",2,,,
When was this put out I’m just shocked it’s even out. Lol reason being should just be able to sneeze since masks are great an suppose to be worn.,1,,,
If we want to help we need laws about coughing not consideration.,3,,,
"I feel coughing into a tissue and throwing it away then Saniztizer hands, Is much safer way. You are coughing up germs into clothes to then carry around with you.",3,,,
WEAR A MASK. OUR LIVES DEPEND UPON IT.,1,,,
Slowly slowly this disease is getting bigger. We have to protect ourselves and the safety of the other is also in our hands.,3,,,
"Even when it's seasonal allergies not a virus cough and sneeze into elbow or Kleenex... I don't want to be spitting on people or vice versa, that's gross enough when my toddler does it never mind a stranger...",3,,,
"And What about the unconscious and ignorant people in our society that they really don't  care about  themselves, how will the idea of ​​covering the face during sneezing come to them and they basically do not believe this epidemic maybe covied_19 must be visible for them to believe just a lot of aware no more",2,,,
"In other words: When you feel like your nose needs to give an ""achoo"" Listen up close, this is what you do Raise your a up high, bend it toward your face And sneeze right *there*, in the bendy place",3,,,
"We were taught this as babies, why is it so difficult to understand this as adults ????? Cover your mouth.",1,,,
It's like guy gobbling on the street as you walk bye? When I was 20 years old 30 years ago it was considered to be disgusting slob thing to do !  But its every where now!  Where has public respect gorn too?  Outer space I'd say,1,,,
"Why isn’t anyone wearing Face masks, WHO I greatly appreciate all your work but there are so many people out there who don’t. You desperately need to get relate to ALL people, even the crazy radicals a rename would be a good start.",1,,,
"I never go out anymore, I'm 69 with Diabetes, heart issues, Asthma, and  C.O.P.D..  luckily my daughter does my Grocery Shopping and picks up my Meds.",3,,,
"Wait, I thought you said we needed to wear masks. So why do I need to cough in my elbow? Does the mask NOT filter out particles when you cough or sneeze?? Hmmm???",2,,,
"Omg the hate comments, and dictating to people are still flowing, hardest subject that people could ever learn In school, the minding their own business ..",3,,,
Just wear a mask at all times if out of your own home!!!!,1,,,
Show consideration by not following the WHO who are actually ran by a cult and use cult tactics to brainwash people,1,,,
Its good habit to create. I sang in choir at church we were to do a concert and the director was adamant about coughing in the arm so no one get sick for concert. And no one got sick either! Sitting close together.,4,,,
Maybe if people weren't such disgusting savages and followed these simple guidelines well before Covid we'd be in a different place.,2,,,
1 meter social distancing is not enough. Considering that the corona virus could be an airborne disease. It should be at least 3 meters social distancing...,3,,,

The manners of good mannering have gone down the toilet we are living in a broken world with disobedient people the sods.,2,,,
"And provide a home for all those expelled germs .... to breed, multiply and infect others....",2,,,
And now everyone thinks they are safer by bumping elbows (that everyone is sneezing into) to stop the spread of a highly survivable virus.  You can't keep this mess straight.,1,,,
"Wear a mask and social distance and stay away from the crowd if you are sick, better to stay home and don't spread the germs!!",1,,,
"BS... my wearing a mask MAINTAINS YOUR FREEDOMS & LIBERTIES!! It's called ALTRUISM OR SELFLESSNESS!! It's not politics, it NEVER was meant to be!

Read the signs, watch the news, catch up on policies before you go, don’t argue or jump all over them.. shut up and go about your business.

You should have a mask on when riding the bus in the first place,2,,,
Thought they had to wear masks anyway !,2,,,
"WHO as much credability as Mickey Mouse, sorry Mickey Mouse has more credability! WHO nothing but a gravy train! Useless!",1,,,
don’t very about corona... it’s just a normal flu.. corona is just a conspiracy by  Pharma companies and W H O ... so take  care and always believe and stay with our natural treatment .. Ayurveda and Naturopathy,2,,,
Incredible how many adults still don't understand this.,2,,,
Just wear a mask .. who wants other's sputtering ext all over them .. show some respect in this time to the old & vunrable & get over yourself for heavens sake,1,,,
Shouldn't the WHO be recommending passengers not only to  keep their social distancing but also wear masks while travelling on public transport.,2,,,
sneezing. I've seen it where people don't bother.,2,,,
"Indeed, being considerate of others is the done thing during this crisis when it comes to coughing, sneezing, distancing and this sort of stuff.",4,,,
They are wearing mask so what is the need to cover with elbow while coughing and sneezing.,2,,,
And with a mask you inhale it back in ?  Sounds healthy,2,,,
Won't share because of the mixed message. No mask shown on train or bus.  I believe they just screwed up on image.,2,,,
"Regardless of the COVID19, I if I were a parent of a child under 12 and, like so many children, they didn’t cover their coughs or sneezes I’d make them wear a mask until they learned to cover their coughs and sneezes. I don’t know why the governments that stipulate people have to wear masks have an exemption for children under twelve citing they don’t know how to wear one. No one knows how to wear one properly until taught.",2,,,
I love it when my kids tells me the child next to them goes to school sick and coughs with their mouth open. Lifestyle habits start at home,3,,,
"What stupid!!! Why not wear Mask?!!!   Thé moment you got tot cough, it is not always possible tot cover your mouth! Please wear Mask !!!",1,,,
People really need to be told to cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing!!,1,,,
I think people are getting tired of your inconsistent messaging. This is really not helpful.,1,,,
To be safe and confident enough it's. Better to cover our nose and mouth when in public,3,,,
Pathetic. It actually isn’t about your rights ; it is about the health of your nation and fellow Americans. Hope you are proud of yourself. Your rich country has one of the worst outcomes in the world due to fools like you and you leaderless country. All those deaths! And Florida groaning under all their cases,1,,,
Bad one non Masked  elbow is also bad cause one may  come in contact with droplets through elbow greet,2,,,
The real problem is the lack of windows. Buses should be made with bigger windows which facilitate the renewal of air inside.,3,,,
BS. Your shirt collar works much better. Just pull it up cover your nose please,1,,,
Better to sneeze into your elbow than a mask and keeping the mask on rest of the day.,3,,,
What to be REALLY considerate of others ... wear a mask!,2,,,
In Luxembourg all passengers are obliged to wear a protective mask!,3,,,
Yes this habits are  vital not only for this pandemic but also    for all the time to avoid any viral infections.,3,,,
Don’t need the WHO to tell me how ton be considerate of others when sneezing.,1,,,
"The most disgusting things is to sneeze in your elbow. Ladies often wear their bags there, men touch that part of their arm with their hand and they all infect others that way. Not to talk about those who don't wash their clothes each day.",3,,,
What if you have a mask on.  This doesn’t make sense!,2,,,
But everyone on public transport had to wear a mask and presumably sneeze into that’s?,3,,,
"Yeah, but what have you done to stop the spread? You knew about this last year but said and did nothing. Now that you stand to make money from us all, you are dictating what we all do. So in the words of John Wick",1,,,
What about sneezing properly into one's tissue?,3,,,
If we have to keep reminding people about how to cough then there parents and TEACHERS did a piss poor job,1,,,
"“Show consideration for other passengers. If you need to cough or sneeze, make sure you cover your mouth with your inner elbow COVID-19.” especially while wearing a mask.",4,,,
Looks like his smelling his armpit which in some cases are more deadlier than this pandemic.,3,,,
Yes must be with mask in public place.  Not like all ANC and they stupid government was on Zinzi Mandela funeral and no one have a mask. Disgusting.  They do not follow their own rules.,1,,,
If this virus is so contagious why are masks and all items that risk coming in contact with it .  Not disposed of as clinical waste.,2,,,
"You can't make me cover my mouth when I cough or sneeze, that's taking away my freedom!",1,,,
Wear a mask! Please and Thank you!,3,,,
Should wear a sugical mask anywhere in this time of pandemic!,2,,,
Even though a mask cover cough or sneeze,3,,,
These passengers need masks! Quick get the sharpie!,3,,,
"Thanks to the World Health Organization advice is certainly an important one.  There is another way to escape from the Covid 19, such as having to think about how to disinfect the car seats with a completely clean Savlon.",5,,,
"WHO you’re behind time, masks are now mandatory on public transport almost everywhere",1,,,
A mask would be better and go with your other guidelines,3,,,

"They should be wearing masks in stead of coughing in elbow, all the passengers are not wearing mask. Not a good demonstrating picture",2,,,
Less Trump supporters,3,,,
Was everyone before this clarification sneezing against each other?  Oh my God,3,,,
"... and then, put you shopping basket on your elbow, your purse, open and close doors with your elbow.... yeah, safe. Tissue, people! And sanitizer!",2,,,
The mental health of residents is also very I'll affected. Short staffing and extra work has also I'll affected the folks.  I wish people had incentive to get back to work and be their best....,3,,,
This needs to stress seeking counseling more. There is too much of a stigma against mental health issues for professionals in healthcare fields.,3,,,
How’s the headline “Are you a doctor nurse or health care professional ?” Ummm no majority obviously are not but I have a question for you WHO... Are you a trust worthy organisation with the best interest for me and my family? Definitely not?,1,,,
Lol anyone else try to make a Doctors appointment and they can’t take you for 2 months .  Who with a medical issue can wait 2 months?  Can we pay doctors better so we get more and don’t have ridiculous wait times for medical care !!,2,,,
"I work in a retail environment,  befor masks were implemented I felt very stressed. I still do if people dont wear their mask correctly. But now i do not depend on my company to give me a mask to wear, i acquired my own where i can put filters in it and I feel much safer since then. If we all adhere to this we all can get our life back sooner than later, let's do this TOGETHER! We can!",2,,,
What are we going to do about lack of PPE supplies again??? My outpatient surgery center is having difficulty ordering supplies do to back order.......,2,,,
"This is an everyday way of dealing with STRESS, even before Covid. What a joke.",1,,,
Yes have social contacts with friends. After they said don't....this is too hilarious,1,,,
The WHO was in on the pandemic with China and Bill Gates. F the WHO.,1,,,
None of your cartoons are wearing masks.  Recommendation noted!,2,,,
Any suggestions as to how we cope with lies and deception?,1,,,
Like the WHO cares! They planned this! Screw them!,1,,,
How Bill Gates and Soroa run the organization? Why US refuses to fund it ?,2,,,
"None of your cartoons are distancing themselves from each other.  Recommendation noted. Thanks, CDC!",1,,,
Thank you each and every one.  Take care and keep safe.,4,,,
One would have to be an absolute fool to still have confidence in anything the WHO advises. People are waking up.  WHO is a fraud.,1,,,
My stress comes from my Govenor! I have only seen a handful of  people with Covid. Test more patients in flu season that come back positive!,3,,,
The WHO is owned by Gates and Faussi so take all your BS and put it where the sun doesn’t shine.,1,,,
Hard times for health care workers. Take care of yourselves so you can take care of others. Stay well.,4,,,
At the end of this month He will become a Corus Ferris from the past,3,,,
Why are they posting stuff in America? Didn't we pull out of WHO?,1,,,
Covid is a bunch of BS and we are all being lied to..I wouldnt trust WHO !!!!,1,,,
Why would anyone listen to these clowns?,1,,,
Best way to cope? Don't fall for it. Use your God given common sense.,1,,,
Do you really think the Don 't know how to cope?? Get real please,1,,,
A significant pay rise would ease a lot of unnecessary stress for the majority of health and key workers.,3,,,
Mainly get the truth. You will get no truth whatsoever from WHO or CDC.,2,,,
Too elementary !   What makes you think I have time to sit with a counsellor !   We’re lucky to get bathroom breaks !,1,,,
These poor people are being run into the ground by selfish jerks who won’t stay home and won’t wear masks.,1,,,
"Greetings to every medical staff working for everyone, perhaps relieving the pressure on these heroes by turning the emergency into a normal phenomenon",5,,,
"Thanks not only nurses, doctors and health professionals even thanks to police and IT professionals",5,,,
WHO cannot be trusted at all. They are owned by the Big Pharma.,1,,,
I have been a little salty lately. I took a break and went to the country to get away from it all.,3,,,
It’s strange coming from an organization who is apart of this crisis. The New World Order. We see you...,1,,,
Praying for all of our health workers. I am sure their mental health is suffering more than the average person. We all appreciate the work you are doing and the risk you are taking to do this work.,5,,,
Thank you to all the healthcare workers and those that are supporting them.,5,,,
Tried running! but in confinement I keep wrecking my knees on furniture!,3,,,
Looking at these comments people are waking up to the truth thank the lord. World health organisation must be destroyed,1,,,
Don't forget about housekeepers at hospitals as well! We go into these rooms and clean them every day!,3,,,
"Not helpful ... if they are forcing nurses to work more shifts for a long period of time while other ppl continue to act irresponsibly , not wearing their masks",2,,,
Wouldn't trust you lot with a computer virus....,1,,,
OR you can provide enough staff and sufficient PPEs.,1,,,
Put this out when you ARE the exact organization that put us here! Right!,1,,,
"Thank you for all you do, and all the help you offer.",5,,,

I am hearing about drs and nurses getting laid off and hospitals are close to empty.  This is a plan demic not a pandemic all motivated by political bs. Wake up!!! How dumbed down do you think we are. So sick of this bs,1,,,
"Crazy, even if WHO is correct just having their name on the article and I want to disagree, 90% of what they say people shouldn’t have to be told, are the people out there really needing to be lead so badly they have to relearn what they should have been taught when they were in grammar school?",2,,,
t Phase” we are all in now.,3,,,
The stress I see does not come from covid.,3,,,
his line if work she Endures and take  a Risks just to help and assists  those to be cure. Hurrah!! for our Frontliners.,5,,,
"No matter how long you are in the job, it can be very stressful and we have never had to deal with the challenges we face today in our Health Service or our Public Safety, so I fully agree with the WHO for putting this notice out because they are thinking about all on the Front line",4,,,
"If my sister were still alive, she would have worked tirelessly to take care of patients. God Bless all of her co-workers who are still on the job. May they and their families stay safe and healthy!",3,,,
Where are the masks on your slide?,2,,,
And also 6 impossible things before breakfast. It would be wonderful if medical workers had time to do ANY of those things,1,,,
Sleep? What's that..?,2,,,
"No one might read this but I definitely  need prayer. Not just now because of the whole corona virus thing but I have been struggling for a very long time, and it just seems that now it’s worse.",3,,,
No health care! No doctor! To expensive! So what now! You go to work sick and you spread the virus! You have no insurance because the company you work for doesn't have any!! Who cares? Oh yes! The man in the White house cares!!!! Not!!!!!!,1,,,
"What an awesome system.  Help to inflate a ""pandemic"" then offer people help when what your doing makes them depressed or stressed because their lives are falling apart. Bravo",1,,,
"Sure, now you want to give advice to us on how to deal with stress, as you try to ruin the world with your one world agenda!!! You act like you really care, when all you want to do is vaccinate and control us all!!!",1,,,
"May GOD bless them all, as their work is so important at these times of CORONA, they have to be rewarded with cash & other incentives for their risking their lives to save our people.",3,,,
"Huge thank you to all of healthcare workers who are putting themselves in harm's way every day with this mess. Especially saving ppl who don't believe it's real, it must feel like such a slap in the face to all of the first responders, all medical staff and every one of essential workers who don't get to stay home.",5,,,
The easiest way to cope with the stress is just to get rid of Trump. That way our healthcare professionals won't have to worry.,3,,,
"2 and 4 are poorly written. 4 is grammatically poor given the lack of parallel structure. I sure hope the French version of this is better written. How pathetically irresponsible! Stop paying these useless bureaucrats who get paid a fortune for poor, low quality work. END THE UN!",1,,,
Thank you to all the first responders and health care workers for all you’re dedication and love of what your doing!!!,5,,,
I am not understanding why people are responding to this post with such anger and frustration. It is useful and valid information. Read it and move on. Take from it what you can and live your life. If you’re unhappy with what you see please just unfollow and go away. No one wants to read your hateful messages full of negative remarks that highlight your ignorance.,5,,,
"Even this is not only for the whole health professionals but everybody. Please keep busy with duties or anyother things to do at home. Mantain our mind in different kind of occupations is the best for no being with stress and other bad health situations. One must be strong and accept the real hard moment, but with much patience and faith in OUR ALMIGHTY.",3,,,
"South Texas is looking for  nurses aides,  doctors, the hospital's are over capacity and the death rate is  climbing,  maybe we are living in a make believe world like you , but the situation is deathly real here, come and see!",1,,,
"Rubbish, if you’ve been working a 100 hours a week, how the hell I you supposed to eat well, sleep well, socialise, or anything other than work and sleep.",1,,,
Zip it WHO!  You were silent when you were needed.  We take this seriously and will take all precautions!,1,,,
"The biggest stressor is dealing with people who are in denial, especially when it's your own family in an area where thankfully the numbers are currently low. If people are not on the same page with this and maintaining safe practices, then there will be so much more loss of life and sickness.",2,,,
Many of these comments are for show. Not real people.  Hospitals tell people to go home & quarantine. The WHO no longer is associated with the USA.,1,,,
WHO is full of it and lying period. This is all engineered in order to destroy America so they can usher in the One world government,1,,,
"Sleep what’s that ??? Riddled with anxiety sleep does not come easy , never had a panic attack till covid constantly questioning myself have I done enough , am I gonna bring covid home to my loved ones . Seriously beginning to not trust WHO !",1,,,
The last thing I need is WHO (a discredited organization) telling me how to cope with anything. They are complicit in this scam of a plandemic.,1,,,
Sooo if I shouldn't use drugs to manage my emotions should people taking anti depressants stop?,2,,,
"my heart goes out to each and every one of you, I know I'm not the same person as I was, actually having some syntoms, but don't want to let it get me down, have too much responsibily,   how the frig can you tell if there is something wrong with you?",2,,,
"LIARS. SCAMMER JAMMERS. CHECK what they did to the previous -decades old- definition of a pandemic. Conveniently REMOVED the Severity clause, whereby it had to be More severe than influenza in symptoms and mortality rates.",1,,,
"How about maybe reporting the actual numbers instead of deciding from minute to minute who has died versus meh...maybe they have it, maybe they don’t.  No one can even keep the numbers right! One day it’s an insane amount that are positive, the next, it’s half of what was just reported!",1,,,
ON   PRESENTATION   OF   TIPS  ON  CORONA   COVID   VIRUS   CONTROL   SYSTEMS    SIR  IT  IS  GOOD  INFORMATION,5,,,
"It makes me feel ill just reading these redundant messages - trying to cover their guilty tracks. WHO could have helped all of us and didn't, during the time we needed protection... back in Jan./20",1,,,
"When all this crisis end, be sure you will not have any credit for it, you were a puppet organization for the whole time.",1,,,
"And some nice ways for ""normal people"" for to cope with stress of loosing job, loosing place to live and being scared like hell for the future of their family?  For people who were closed home for 4 month and still are not allowed to live normally ? For people who were fed with big numbers whole this time ? For depressed and sucidal because they lost bussinesses ?",1,,,
You can also relieve stress if you are a medic or working in a care center by falling in love with your colleague.,3,,,
Too late infographics guide...too late WHO for this public advisory ... many front liners health worker has already pro-actively doing this ...its already @2020 July,1,,,
I would think that this would be for everyone dealing with this pandemic.,3,,,
"FYI...there are other essential jobs out there that need this as well...for example, grocery workers, delivery personnel such as UPS, USPS, FedEx and Amazon delivery folks. Healthcare workers are as close as it gets, however these others are just as stressed",3,,,
My two sons work as emergency  practitioners  when they come home they necks are stiff i have to rub it with ointment and give anti inflammatory  tablets its realy stresfull to transport covid emegency patience but the both of them have a passion  for carring,2,,,
Safety tip! One thing WHO must do to free individual countries from COVID 19. *set a common timetable on when the whole world would observe the lockdown giving all necessary guidelines through sensitization. NB. World leaders must ensure that these guidelines are strictly followed in their countries.,3,,,
The whole world is feeling it. Some respond to these feelings better than others. Try to be understanding toward those who become upset or slip into denial.,2,,,

Brought to you by the organisation that six months ago was saying Covid19 wasn't serious or spread human to human,1,,,
Ehh point three. We can't socialise with friends or family. Unfair to put our loved ones at risk when we risk contracting it every day,3,,,
During this crisis of course very stressful for everyone but more stressed for nurses and Doctors cientistas hospitals teachers to dill and support the healthcare issues during this period of the time with a coronavirus  ..take care everyone and stay safe and positive..,4,,,
Thanks to all the healthcare workers out there who continue to risk their own well being as well as possibly that of their families. May God and his angels watch over you and yours so you can continue to help save the lives of many. Stay well.,3,,,

"Talk to people you trust, social contacts? In this case, where is the social distancing? Why do you say the opposite to the average people?? Healthcare workers are different or what? I think, these ""tips""  belong to the normal life, for everyone. No exception.",3,,,
How about paying health professionals properly - ensuring they have enough to live on and can feed their children? Wouldn’t that help with the stress? How about shorter shifts too?,2,,,
Please do as the WHO  dictates all you paid “frontline workers “! Especially the snowflakes that can’t determine that this is a plandemic and nothing more than a common cold  Go home to your safe spaces  and self cuddle and please do it hard enough so that when you come back for your next shift you are totally focused,2,,,5
Continuous prayers for all the healthcare workers from the janitor to the parking lot attendant and all doctors nurses and caregivers in Jesus name,3,,,

What about the mental health problems it is causing children. Depression is increasing. Everything was taken from them and they are struggling with it.

"To everyone who is out working with public not just healthcare, many people who are currently engaged with the public are dealing with very sad, depressed people or very angry violent people it is a changing time and uncertainty is creating fear. So if your a hospital, store clerk, stock person , gas attendant, fast food worker protect yourself on the inside as well, deep breaths and try to focus on some positive each day. Lift up your fellow healthcare workers  & essential workers when you see them in your lines - they are exhausted just like you, mentally and physically.",2,,,
What's all this stress? I've been working everyday since it started and not feeling stressed.,3,,,

If anyone needs help coping with stress during this time just turn off the news. They have almost single handily blown this virus out of proportion.,3,,,
This is nice gesture but most business are not interested in protecting employees I work in public sector and I am just amazed about the treatment we received during this time,2,,,
To all health workers everywhere:  You are the true American heroes.  You are to 2020 what the firemen who ran back onto the Twin Towers were to 2001.  Bless you.,5,,,
If you didn't get this virus it's not because of musk or hand sanitizer but it's God who protected you Let's keep on praying and use there instructions what doctors were given us don't refuse plz   But let's pray harder coz it's only God who can ending up this virus,3,,,
"God is only the one we can trust and talk, he is our doctor,, if we believe in our God with all our heart and love him eternally, corona is  made only a person who wants panicking and worried, Satan cannot defeat our God,,,, in marcos 16:16 says whoever call in the name of the Lord shall be save oh lord jesus we love you",3,,,
"The WHO lied to us in the beginning, so why should we believe them now",1,,,
"Or just tell it's a hoax If WHO banned doing obduction to any covid positive dead person than all the numbers of covid death toll are just assumption and not real legal documented proof of death cause. Only obduction can claim real cause of death. They faking numbers, it's about plandemic lie to introduce NWO. You sheep's better wake up.",1,,,
WHO can take its advice and shove it. Sane people are not listening to WHO anymore.,1,,,
Being in the profession is a everyday stress not only during these covid times ..we need to b recognized as humans as well .,2,,,
Masks are non FDA approved. Thats why the warning says they protect you against nothing!,2,,,
"Agree but it's hard these days to find people to trust anymore. Friends who I thought I could trust or turn to all went away now. I forgave them for not caring or for what they wronged me about so feel more content to be alone now because they got me used to being alone b4 I was tossed aside ( NOT good friends after all). I wish them all well though but realize I can't make someone care if they don't. I find my own happiness w/music & comedies & good music about others living good lives ( Hallmark or TRUE Christian way of living). I sometimes put myself in the movie then when it's over, it's back to reality but feel better because glad they have it better than me . The guilty lose & the innocent end up in good endings w/better lives the way life should be. Don't want anyone to feel like I do because we NEED people to start caring again by going by the Golden Rule from now on.",4,,,
"Yes hard times for our very hard working mental health care workers but every now and then they seem to forget your still needing their valuable help, and where are you left when you can’t lift the phone or ask for help, so sorry for this blip as I appreciate there help so much and miss them with the understanding they in turn are under a lot of stress also.",4,,,
"MASKS SHOULD ALSO ONLY BE WORN BY THOSE AT RISK OF GETTING SICK WHEN OUT IN PUBLIC, OR ONLY WHEN IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMEONE WITH CORONA. WE ALL NEED TO STOP BEING SO AFRAID AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO  BUILD UP SOME ANTIBODIES!!!! CHILDREN ARE NOT AT RISK OF CATCHING NOR SPREADING THE VIRUS  NO MORE THAN  THE COLD OR THE FLU. READ UP ON THIS IN THE NEW ENGLAND MEDICAL JOURNAL!!!!! COME ON PEOPLE! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!",2,,,
Time to calm down and get back to living. It's not going anywhere. We need to accept it is a virus.,3,,,
alking to a professional can work wonders.,3,,,
"Sure in between the overtime and crisis decline in number of available nurses in Florida in addition to our governor who continues to be convinced all is well and no precautions are necessary, meanwhile your COVID ICU is full of intubated proned young patients with no medical history ... and a growing number of medical offices refusing to even take hospital staff in an appointment due to higher risk ...

The best thing to do is research the truth.  Covid was a setup to instill fear and to control.,1,,,
"y bleakens your outlook from the start. Sad is not the new normal. Sadness is not a good place and it should be avoided if possible. If you are in it then the default should be encouraging you out of it.  Why not have your opening point as pride and positivity in your healthcare role? Sure it can be hard (it is!) but, in general, can we not pick the positive route as a default?  It's rather normalising being sad as the new cool. Be positive instead.",2,,,

"WHO/You planned all this and now you want to see people's reactions? You are very sick ""people""...",1,,,
Too little too late. End the shutdown before everything really implodes. Talk about your connections with Bill Gates as well. No thanks to your freakish new normal,1,,,

Not only health workers are suffering from stress the whole world is. So please be louder more in this area as you are louder with covid 19 new infections. Many people are now very vulnerable and becoming sick often which puts pressure in hospitals. It doesn't mean covid 19 is spoken of more other diseases have stopped to exist. People are now dealing with whatever sickness they had before plus covid 19. So more propaganda on mental health,2,,,
Easy to read but how do you do it when food is being restricted by our government some people has no food so this advertising is for the cabinet,2,,,

"Such a corona virus will never be eradicated. The first case of a corona virus occurred in China, then this one case spread all over the world.  ۔  The disease originated in China and spread so fast to Canada, USA, Turkey, India, Pakistan, Italy, Germany, UK, Spain and even the whole world.  And there were no giants that spread so fast.  These are just the assumptions of scientists and doctors that came true. Otherwise, it was a hypothesis. Otherwise, it was an assumption. Call it the misfortune of the world.  Is.  Why and how is it happening?  The assumptions and advice of scientists and doctors have ruined the health and economy of the world.  I warn no country to blame each other because the corona virus is not a contagious disease.  The corona virus is spreading through a process that our scientists and doctors have not been able to reach.  There are three stages of the corona virus.  Where, why and how the corona virus is born. The corona virus will never be eradicated from the world until we understand it.  We want to draw the attention of scientists and doctors to the need to stop the congenital process of coronavirus and treat it successfully.  Finding the Corona virus in a week will not help.  What treatments already exist in the world?  The purpose of this post is to make it clear to these scientists and doctors that they control and control the congenital process of coronavirus. I have cured many patients in this way.",3,,,

"Appreciating Peace Ambassadors and Advocates working towards achieving the sustainable development goals for peace, dignity, human rights, freedom, equality, healthy planet, humanity, culture and education. May God continue to sustain and empower us as we appreciate him for the gift of life.   O Lord, our God make our  attentive to the need of others. Make us an instrument of your love and peace to those who are troubled and without hope. Amen.  God's plan is always the Best. Sometimes the process is painful and hard. But don't forget that when God is silent. He's doing something for us.  Why, O Lord, do you stand afar?  Why hide from us in times of trouble? In their pride the wicked harass the weak, the poor become victims of their evil schemes. The exploiter Wallows in his power and greed; the covetous blasphemes and renounces God. In his pride the wicked says, ""God will not call me to account."" He always thinks, ""There is no God.""  His mouth is full of curses, deceit and threats; spite and mischief are under his tongue, murdering the innocent and the unfortunate, looking out for his next victim.   Happy Nelson Mandela Day.  Take Action, Inspire Change. Make every day a Mandela Day.  July 18th is the celebration of 102 Birth Anniversary of World Leaders Nelson Mandela.   Raise your words, not your Voice  It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.   The Measure of Success is Happiness and Peace of Mind. The Lord will not abandon his people, nor forsake those who are his heritage. For judgement shall again be just and all true hearts shall uphold it. Blessed are you Father.
